# Technical Documentation Page

This project is a simple and responsive technical documentation page, built using **HTML** and **CSS**. It includes a fixed navigation bar that allows users to navigate between different sections of the documentation. The page layout adjusts for smaller screens to ensure a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The page is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal user experience on both large screens (desktops/laptops) and smaller screens (mobile devices).
- **Fixed Navigation**: The left-side navigation bar is fixed on larger screens, allowing easy access to the different sections of the documentation without losing the position on the page.
- **Smooth Section Links**: Clicking on a navigation link scrolls to the corresponding section in the documentation.
- **Media Queries**: The layout changes for smaller screen sizes (below 800px), where the navbar moves to the top of the page and the content expands to full width.

## Sections Included

- **Introduction**: Overview of the technical documentation.
- **JavaScript and Java**: Explains the similarities and differences between JavaScript and Java.
- **CSS and HTML**: Discusses the relationship between CSS for styling and HTML for structuring web pages.
- **Variables**: Describes the concept of variables in programming.
- **Functions**: Provides an overview of how functions work in various programming languages.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Markup language for structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: Stylesheet language used to style the layout and make the page responsive.
